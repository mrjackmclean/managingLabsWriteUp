I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Ruth Letham, for going above and beyond in providing advice, guidance, inspiration and for showing patience! Not only did my supervisor's guidance help me to develop the codeHelper application and complete this project, but throughout this project and the final taught semester helped me to reach a level that I couldn't have imagined before starting this degree. 

I would also like to thank my family, specifically my Mum, Wendy McLean, my partner, Grace Goldsmith, my partner's parents, Mark and Linda Goldsmith, for supporting me, reassuring me and putting up with me. I would also like to give a special thanks to my tiny best friend Wall-E, whose distraction from work was maddening but I couldn't have done without. 

Further, I would like to thank the friends that I made throughout this degree, namely Ann-Kathrin Losse, Paul Kipp and Leopold Pfeiffer. It was a difficult year to meet friends and to undertake this degree in general, I am extremely lucky to have met them and couldn't have done it without their motivation, guidance and friendship.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the participants of the evaluation experiment, whose feedback was invaluable in evaluating and improving the project.
